Prepared python script to evaluate given input and produce non-perfect soln. output.

Coded in limited time. No optimizations and choice of python gave us time penalty when we were executing the big data.

Uses kadir_score_lib function to score given lib.

roughly, Algorithm is:

read all libraries and create library objects including all essential information to score them.

score all libraries and pick the best library with respect to score function. Let this library register. Registered books' points set to 0.

repeat above procedure to finish available days.

results:

Although we couldn't execute the big data input, we placed on 50%.
